## [4.18.0] – 2026-05-14

### ✨ New Features

- **(Presence) Talking Head customisation** — A new sub-category under Presence that lets you style Blizzard's Talking Head frame without a separate addon:
  - Enable/disable the frame entirely
  - Mute the voice-over independently of game volume
  - Separate font family, outline, and size for both the NPC name and dialogue text
  - Name colour picker
  - Show/hide the NPC portrait and decorative frame ring
  - Show/hide the cinematic background and close button
  - Frame scale (0.5×–2.0×)
- **(Focus) Focused Quest category** — Super-tracked quests hoist into their own reorderable **FOCUSED QUEST** section so the focused quest can be pinned anywhere in the tracker — including just above the bottom-anchored header when grow-up is enabled.
- **(Focus) Mythic+ split timers** — The M+ block adds a split-timer line showing remaining time to the +1, +2, and +3 cut-offs. Tiers you've already crossed dim out so it's clear at a glance which upgrades are still reachable. Configurable font size and colour, with a separate colour for crossed tiers.
- **(Insight) Tooltip Preview window & new toggles** — The dashboard preview now sizes player, NPC, and item tooltips to fit their actual content rather than a shared fixed width. Live player tooltips gain Shift-modifier refresh, per-stat (Mythic+ / item level / honor) Force/Modifier/Hide modes, per-status-badge toggles (Combat, AFK, DND, PvP, Group, Friend, Targeting You), a Spec-Override class-icon mode, a Realm Names dropdown, a Section Separation dropdown, and bundled race icons, including the new Haranir race plus Dracthyr and its Visage form.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Shrink-to-fit width** — The Focus tracker can grow in width to fit the longest visible row, capped at a configurable maximum, so progress bars no longer stretch wider than the tracked content needs.
- **(Focus) Progress bar text inherits objective colour** — Progress label text ("3/10 (30%)") now matches its category-aware objective colour by default instead of near-white, while a custom Progress Bar Text Colour pick still overrides.
- **Localisation** — German locale refreshed, plus ongoing locale hygiene across the other non-English locales.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Presence)** Disabling Zone Notifications now hides them correctly.
- **(Focus)** Objective lines with a leading dash no longer double up the bullet prefix.

---

## [4.17.7] – 2026-05-09

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Vista) Circular Horizon button** — A round minimap-button variant so the Horizon icon matches addons like SexyMap and HidingBar that style their buttons round.
- **(Presence) Font outline options** — Presence text gains the same outline picker as the rest of the addon (None, Thin Outline, Thick Outline, Monochrome Outline, SLUG).
- **(Insight) Character titles and title colour** — Suffix titles now render correctly (including comma-prefixed forms like *"Aragorn, the Argent Champion"*), and a new Title Colour dropdown lets you pick **Match Name**, **Match Name (Gradient)**, or **Custom**.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Insight)** Guild rank now displays correctly in player tooltips — no more realm name leaking into the rank slot, and the rank sits inline beside the guild name.
- **(Vista)** Square minimap mode no longer errors when clearing the Horizon button's highlight texture.

---

## [4.17.6] – 2026-05-08

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus)** Bar texture and colour changes now apply live without requiring a UI reload.
- **(Axis)** Welcome and News content now respects the Dashboard Font option instead of using a hardcoded font.
- **(Axis) Configurable Dashboard heading colour** — Choose a softer accent colour for the Welcome and News headings so pure white at full HDR luminance no longer dominates the UI.

---

## [4.17.5] – 2026-05-07

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Mythic+ block "Always Show" toggle now displays the block as a preview when you're outside a Mythic+ dungeon — previously it had no effect. The toggle is reset to off on upgrade so the new preview doesn't appear unexpectedly. Tooltip wording updated to match.

---

## [4.17.4] – 2026-05-04

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis) SLUG font outline options** — The shared outline dropdown now offers SLUG, SLUG Outline, and SLUG Thick Outline choices alongside the existing Outline and Thick Outline variants.
- **Localisation** — English settings labels and tooltip descriptions now follow Title Case consistently (e.g. "Focus Objective Tracker", "Loot Toast Font", "Tooltip Anchor Mode").

---

## [4.17.3] – 2026-05-02

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Localisation** — Non-English clients (German, Spanish, French, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese) once again display in the player's selected language instead of falling back to English. A file load order regression in 4.17.2 caused English strings to overwrite every translation at startup.

---

## [4.17.2] – 2026-05-02

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Ritual Site objective counters** — Ritual Site scenario headers now display their currency icons and progress values alongside the rest of the scenario objectives.
- **(Vista) Configurable drawer icon picker** — When the floating drawer button is enabled, you can now choose a custom Blizzard icon or texture path for it instead of being stuck with the default.

---

## [4.17.1] – 2026-04-29

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Insight)** Tooltip quality colour now matches the item's actual rarity instead of occasionally showing the wrong border and name colour.

---

## [4.17.0] – 2026-04-28

### ✨ New Features

- **(Focus) Static Background Size** — Optionally lock the Focus tracker background to a fixed size so it stays consistent regardless of how many quests, M+ timers, or scenarios are tracked.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Cache) Per-module font picker with locale-aware default** — Cyrillic, Korean, and other non-Latin glyphs now render correctly in the loot display, and each module can pick its own font.

---

## [4.16.1] – 2026-04-26

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Vista)** Mail icon tooltip now lists senders like the default Blizzard tooltip — see who sent each piece of mail without opening the mailbox.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Quest icon clicks in Blizzard+ mode now reliably focus the quest, even after the slot previously rendered a non-quest row.
- **(Focus)** Auctionator search button now appears immediately on tracked recipe entries when the Auction House opens.

---

## [4.16.0] – 2026-04-25

### ✨ New Features

- **(Axis) Dashboard smart open routing** — The dashboard now resumes wherever you left it (including module sub-categories), and the Welcome page only appears once on first install.
- **(Axis) Patch notes popup** — On the first reload after an update, a small standalone popup shows the latest release notes instead of taking over the dashboard, so your last view is preserved. "View all patch notes" jumps to the full history.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Vista)** The Crafting Orders minimap icon no longer flashes briefly on characters with no pending orders.
- **(Vista)** The Crafting Orders tooltip now lists each profession with a pending order beneath the total, instead of only showing a count.

---

## [4.15.0] – 2026-04-24

### ✨ New Features

- **(Axis) Settings overhaul — Axis first** — Start of a broader Horizon settings and Dashboard overhaul. Axis is the first module to land with a reorganised, more consistent options layout; other modules will follow in subsequent releases.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis) Staged Reload UI for profile changes** — Toggling Global profile, switching the current profile, enabling Spec Profiles, or picking a per-spec profile now stages a single "Reload UI" prompt (matching the Modules pattern) instead of reloading on every click. Dependent widgets update their enabled state live.
- **(Axis) Dashboard class-colour controls** — New master toggle gates the Dashboard's class-colour treatments, with sub-toggles for the class-colour background override and the class icon so each can be turned on independently.
- **(Focus) Independent Timer and Options fonts** — Timer Text and Options Text are no longer tied to the Title/Objective fonts and can be styled independently.
- **(Vista) Crafting Orders minimap indicator** — Adds Crafting Orders support to the Vista minimap with the same appearance and triggering conditions as the Blizzard default.
- **(Vista) Unlocked icons render semi-transparent** — Vista minimap icons now display semi-transparent when unlocked, providing a clear visual cue that they're in a movable state.
- **(Localisation)** Updated German (deDE) translations from a Discord submission.
- **(Localisation)** Options name labels now use headline-style capitalisation across the panel.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Daily recurring quests now appear in their own Daily section instead of being grouped under Weekly.
- **(Focus)** Collapsing then quickly re-expanding a category no longer leaves a blank space with no quests rendered.
- **(Focus)** Accepting a quest now animates in smoothly instead of popping the slot open and flashing into position.
- **(Focus)** Disabling a per-element font toggle now reverts that element to the global font immediately.
- **(Vista)** Crafting Orders indicator now repairs correctly and honours the unified minimap drag positioning.
- **(Axis)** Toggling the minimap icon now saves immediately so the setting survives an instant reload.

---

## [4.14.0] – 2026-04-22

### ✨ New Features

- **(Focus) Delve Nemesis groups indicator** — While in a Delve, the main Focus row can show Nemesis enemy groups remaining (and the completed checkmark state).

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Blizzard+ Click Style: clicking a tracked line with the chat window open now shares the item to chat instead of untracking it, Ctrl+Left-click on collection items opens the preview/wardrobe window, and Right-click → Open Collections navigates to the correct category and item instead of the default first tab.

---

## [4.13.0] – 2026-04-21

### ✨ New Features
- **(Insight) Gradient tooltip fonts** — Item tooltips render in quality-colour gradients; player character tooltips use class-colour gradients.

### 🔧 Improvements
- **(Focus)** Significant performance improvements — quest update events are debounced, rare and treasure vignette scans are consolidated and cached, and layout passes are skipped when position hasn't changed.
- **(Vista)** Minimap button collector now offers alphabetical sorting for a more predictable button order.

---

## [4.12.6] – 2026-04-19

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Tooltip no longer covers the tracker** — Focus hover tooltips now pin to the outer edge of the Horizon panel so they never overlap the tracker, whether the panel is docked on the left or right side of the screen.
- **(Insight) Dynamic Focus tooltips in Fixed mode** — New toggle keeps Focus tracker tooltips on the dynamic edge anchor even when all other Insight tooltips stay pinned to the fixed position.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Focus hover tooltips (quests, rares, endeavors, recipes, LFG/AH buttons, floating quest item, M+ block) now honour the Insight anchor mode (Cursor / Fixed) instead of always anchoring right of the hovered widget.
- **(Insight)** Cursor:Center anchor now correctly centres the tooltip at the cursor instead of switching to the Fixed anchor position.
- **(Focus)** WoWhead click-combo hint now shows "Shift + Left click" and its variants instead of raw tokens like `shiftLeft`.

---

## [4.12.5] – 2026-04-18

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Meta quests under Weekly** — Weekly meta quests now group under the Weekly section alongside other weekly-reset activities.
- **(Focus) Completed count tidier** — Completed-count suffixes (e.g. `0/1`, `1/1`) no longer appear on single-objective quests.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Tracked recipe title and objective colours now follow the Axis Colors **Recipes** swatches instead of forcing the default sage-green.
- **(Axis)** Profile switching now fully refreshes class colours, frame positions, and imported settings without requiring a reload.

---

## [4.12.4] – 2026-04-16

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Insight)** Rolled back a recent change that was causing issues.

---

## [4.12.3] – 2026-04-16

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis) Module name style** — New setting to control how module names appear: **Horizon** (code-name only, default), **Subtitle** (e.g. "Vista – Minimap"), or **Simple** (plain-language name only). Applies across options navigation and section headers.
- **(Focus) Grow Upwards priority order** — With **Grow Upwards** enabled, section headers now visually flip so High priority sits closest to the Objectives header at the bottom, matching the reversed growth direction.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Current Event now reappears for World Quests you have **untracked** when you enter their zone, so the in-area event banner works without needing to re-track the quest.

---

## [4.12.2] – 2026-04-14

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Insight) Gate NotifyInspect on player tooltip options** — Disabling every option under Player Characters now fully stops Insight from sending inspect requests on player mouseover, so other inspect-dependent addons are no longer interrupted. A new "Spec icon & role" toggle controls the spec/role line and its inspect query.

---

## [4.12.1] – 2026-04-13

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Warbound weekly quests now sort and track correctly; right-click to untrack no longer fails for Warbound weeklies.
- **(Focus)** Quest item button cooldowns now update properly while in combat.

---

## [4.12.0] – 2026-04-12

### ✨ New Features

- **(Axis)** **Resizable dashboard** with a **corner grabber**, **saved size and position**, and shared **layout scaling** helpers
- **(Axis)** **Ctrl+F** opens dashboard **search** from the options UI, and the search field is **focused** after you change **sidebar** sections

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis)** **Handheld and narrow layouts** — patch notes and headers reflow without overlap, the **search bar** stays constrained, the **sidebar** scroll resets sensibly when content fits, and **accordions** / **two-column tiles** adapt on resize
- **(Vista)** **Minimap button** visibility and related settings are grouped under **Vista** with other minimap UI options

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Tracked **world quests** open on the **correct zone map** instead of the wrong area view
- **(Axis)** Dashboard layout stays **usable** on very **small** or **handheld-sized** windows — overlap, width, and resize **edge cases**

---

## [4.11.0] – 2026-04-10

### ✨ New Features

- **(Axis)** Dashboard search: **filter results by module**

- **(Axis)** Welcome refresh and **minimap-open** keyboard fix
- **(Focus)** Unify **objective tracker icon** clicks with click profiles

---

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis)** Release packages no longer include internal **docs** and **tools** folders after packager and ignore updates
- **(Insight)** Item quality used for tooltip styling follows current item info data more reliably

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Quest-complete row no longer wipes the **inline countdown** on timed click-to-complete quests
- **(Insight)** **World-cursor** NPC tooltips — fewer errors and sturdier default cursor anchoring
- **(Insight)** **Player** tooltips keep custom styling when you move away and hover the same unit again
- **(Insight)** **Unit** tooltips keep addon content when Blizzard refreshes the frame via SetUnit

---

## [4.9.4] – 2026-04-07

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Insight)** NPC tooltips keep Blizzard’s subtitle on the second line when the custom level line is enabled — level moves to line three when the subtitle is real content, not the level row

---

## [4.9.3] – 2026-04-06

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis)** Dashboard typography: body text size in pixels, outline style dropdown, and text shadow toggle, with migration from older offset/outline/shadow keys

---

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Insight)** Tooltip flags use hook-sourced state to avoid unsafe Midnight secret boolean checks
- **(Vista)** Difficulty text is anchored to the minimap, independent of the zone label
- **(Localization)** Locale restructure uses plain commented stubs (no `NEEDS TRANSLATION` suffix); multiline commented stubs and tooling updated accordingly

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Axis)** Dashboard options search: accordion rows no longer overlap after jumping to a match

---

## [4.9.1] – 2026-04-06

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis)** German (deDE) options and dashboard strings updated from a contributor export — many new or revised translations (appearances, click actions, context menu, backgrounds, Presence options); all locale files aligned with English key order via restructure

---

## [4.8.6] – 2026-04-05

- **(Focus)** Delves section only picks up Delve-tagged quests from your log while you’re in a delve, instead of treating every nearby quest as Delve content

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus)** Long objective lines wrap within the tracker after zone or affix rows, and wrapped affix names keep the first objective left-aligned under the full affix block

---

---

## [4.8.4] – 2026-04-05

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus)** Delve affix names keep your tracker font; middle-dot separators use the game font so narrow fonts no longer show missing glyphs between modifiers
- **(Focus)** Long delve affix lists wrap within the tracker width and objectives sit below the full affix block instead of overlapping

---

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus)** When objective count colouring is on, the slash between X and Y uses the same tint so the whole token reads as one styled unit
- **(Axis)** Module dashboard background defaults to Midnight; existing flat defaults migrate once; the flat style is labelled Minimalistic in settings
- **(Axis)** Bundled Night Fae and Zin-Azshari dashboard background art; legacy stored theme ids normalise to Midnight while the options list stays streamlined

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Axis)** Dashboard Welcome tab is driven by a configurable feed and a dedicated view, so announcements and sections are easier to maintain and extend

---

## [4.4.1] – 2026-03-30

---

## [4.2.2] – 2026-03-24

---

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Promotion animation** — Only the promoted quest fades out then fades in at the top; fixed blank space until next event.

---

## [1.1.2] – 2026-02-15

---

## [1.1.1] – 2026-02-14

- **(Focus) Shift+Right-click abandon** — Confirm abandon now works correctly when using Shift+Right-click on quests.
---

## [1.1.0] – 2026-02-14

- **(Focus) Endeavor tracking** — Track Endeavors in the Focus list. Names load on reload without opening the panel; left-click opens the housing dashboard.
- **(Focus) Achievement requirements display** — Option to only show missing requirements for tracked achievements; completed criteria are shown in green.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **(Focus) Spacing slider** — Slider in Display → Spacing to adjust the gap below the objectives bar (0–24 px), preventing the first line from being cut off.
- **(Focus) Dim non-focused quests** — Display option to dim full quest details and section headers for non-focused quests.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** World quests no longer remain in the tracker after changing zones (e.g. hearthing to another zone).

---

## [1.0.6] – 2026-02-14

### 🐛 Fixes

- **(Focus)** Quest text (objectives, timers) now updates during combat — Content-only refresh runs when ScheduleRefresh is requested in combat.
- **(Presence)** Quest progress and kills in combat now show Presence toasts — Removed combat lock in QueueOrPlay so progress and kills (e.g. Argent Tournament jousting) appear.
---

## [1.0.5] – 2026-02-14

### ✨ New Features

- **(Focus) Super-compact mode — options and collapse** — Super-minimal mode now has a thin bar with expand/collapse and a compact "O" options button. Objectives can be opened when "Start collapsed" is set.
---

## [1.0.4] – 2026-02-14

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Focus — Quest-area world quests when option is off** — When "Show in-zone world quests" is disabled, the tracker still shows WQs when you physically enter their quest area (distance-based proximity using C_TaskQuest.GetQuestLocation, matching default Blizzard behavior). Zone-wide WQs remain hidden.
- **Presence — Colours and quest-type icon aligned with Focus** — Presence notifications now use the same colour palette and options as Focus. Quest Complete and Quest Accept colours are driven by quest type (campaign, world, default, etc.); Achievement uses Focus bronze; World Quest uses Focus purple; Quest Update uses Nearby blue; zone/subzone use default title and campaign gold subtitle. Boss emote uses a dedicated red in Config. When "Show quest type icons" is enabled in options, quest-related Presence toasts (accept, complete, world quest) show the same quest-type icon as the Focus tracker.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Focus Tracker — ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED** — Fixed error when `HSFrame:Hide()` was called during combat. Protected Hide() calls are now guarded by InCombatLockdown() and deferred until PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED.
---

## [1.0.3] – 2026-02-13

### ✨ New Features

- **Quest header count** — Option to show quest count as tracked/in-log (e.g. 4/19, default) or in-log/max-slots (e.g. 19/35). Uses `isHidden` for an accurate in-log count.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Focus — Granular spacing options** — Vertical gaps are now user-configurable via sliders in Display → Spacing: between quest entries (2–20 px), before and after category headers (0–24 px, 0–16 px), and between objectives (0–8 px). Compact mode applies a preset (4 px entries, 1 px objectives).
- **Presence — World Quest Accept** — World quest accepts now use a dedicated purple-style notification type (`WORLD_QUEST_ACCEPT`) instead of sharing the standard quest accept style.
---

## [1.0.2] – 2026-02-13

### ✨ New Features

- **Track specific world quests when WQs are off** — Watch-list and super-tracked world quests now appear in the tracker even when the general world quests option is disabled. You can turn off auto-added zone WQs while still seeing the ones you explicitly track.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Mythic+ design** — Improved M+ block layout and styling in the Focus tracker.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Focus Tracker — per-category collapse** — Section header collapse (clicking category headers like Campaign, World Quests) no longer delays or flickers. The collapse animation starts immediately and section headers stay visible during the animation.
- **Focus Tracker — main collapse** — Main tracker collapse behaviour refined: ensures the update loop runs when toggling collapse, and section headers display correctly when a single category is collapsed.
---

## [1.0.1] – 2026-02-13

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Focus Tracker — completed achievements** — The tracker no longer clutters the list with achievements you’ve already finished. Completed achievements are hidden by default; you can turn on “Show completed achievements” in options if you want to see them.
- **Focus Tracker — collapse** — Collapsing the tracker now behaves correctly: the collapse animation starts right away, section headers stay visible while it animates, and a single category still shows its header when collapsed.
---

## [1.0.0] – 2026-02-13

### ✨ New Features

- **Modular architecture** — Horizon Suite is now a core addon with pluggable modules. The Focus (objective tracker) is the first module. A new **Modules** category in options lets you enable or disable each suite. Use `/horizon toggle` or Options → Modules → Enable Focus module to turn the tracker on or off. Additional suites will appear as modules in the same options panel. SavedVariables remain compatible; existing installs default to Focus enabled.
- **Presence module** — Cinematic zone text and notifications. Replaces default zone/subzone text, level-up, boss emotes, achievements, quest accept/complete/update, and world quest banners with styled notifications. Priority queueing, smooth entrance/exit animations, and "Discovered" lines for zone discoveries. Enable in Options → Modules → Enable Presence module. Test with `/horizon presence` (e.g. `/horizon presence zone`, `/horizon presence all`). Blizzard frames are fully restored when Presence is disabled. (Renamed from Vista; `/horizon vista` is now `/horizon presence`.)

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Performance optimizations** — Reduced CPU usage by replacing per-frame OnUpdate with event-driven logic and timers: scenario heartbeat and map check now use C_Timer tickers; main tracker OnUpdate runs only when animating or lerping; Presence OnUpdate runs only during cinematics; scenario timer bars use a shared 1s tick instead of per-bar updates; options toggle OnUpdate runs only during its short animation.
- **Options panel UX overhaul** — Cinematic, modern, minimalistic redesign: softer colour palette with low-contrast borders and dividers; pill-shaped search input; taller sidebar tabs with hover states; minimal X close button; section cards with inset backgrounds; refined toggles, sliders, dropdowns, and colour swatches; subtle dividers between colour-matrix sections; consistent hover feedback on buttons and tabs.
- **Search bar redesign** — Custom-styled search input without Blizzard template: search icon (spyglass) on the left, integrated clear button (visible only when typing), subtle focus state with accent-colour border, and tighter visual connection to the results dropdown.
---

## [0.7.1] – 2026-02-13

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Zone labels** — Refined how quest zone names are chosen so objectives show clearer, more accurate zone labels, especially when quests span parent/child maps.
- **Mythic+ integration** — Improved how Mythic+ objectives and blocks behave in the tracker and options, with clearer descriptions and more consistent behaviour.
- **Options usability** — Polished several option labels and descriptions (including Mythic+ and zone-related settings) to better explain what they do and how they interact.
- **Options panel overhaul** — Fixed search so clicking a result now switches to the correct category and scrolls to that setting. Settings are reorganized into eight categories (Layout, Visibility, Display, Features, Typography, Appearance, Colors, Organization) for easier discovery. Toggles use a rounded pill style; search results show category and section with the option name emphasised.
- **World quest map fallback removed** — World quests are now sourced only from live APIs (`GetTasksTable`, `C_QuestLog.GetQuestsOnMap`, `C_TaskQuest` map APIs, and waypoint fallback) without requiring the world map to be open. The previous map-open cache and heartbeat fallback have been removed.
---

## [0.7.0] – 2026-02-13

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Version 0.7.0** — Release bump.
---

## [0.6.9] – 2026-02-13

- **Dungeon support** — Quest tracking now supports Dungeon quests so dungeon objectives appear correctly in the tracker.
- **Delve support** — Delve quests are supported with updated event handling so Delve objectives are tracked and displayed.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Floating quest item button** — Styling, text case options, and UI layout improved. Button behaviour and layout (e.g. icon, label, progress) are more consistent and configurable.
- **Quest caching** — Quest ID retrieval and caching logic refactored for better reliability. Event handling and debugging around quest updates have been improved.
- **README** — Documentation revised for clarity and formatting.
---

## [0.6.6] – 2026-02-11

### ✨ New Features

- **Weekly quests** — New category for weekly (recurring) quests with its own section in the tracker. Weekly quests in your current zone are auto-added like world quests. Quest classification now uses a single source of truth for determining world quests.
- **Daily quests** — Daily quests are supported with their own section and labeling. Daily quests in your current zone are auto-added to the tracker. Quests that are available to accept but not yet accepted show an **"— Available"** label.
- **Focus sort mode** — In Options → Categories, you can choose how entries are ordered within each category: **Alphabetical**, **Quest Type**, **Zone**, or **Quest Level**. A new options section controls sorting within categories.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Quest caching** — Quest caching logic improved for your current zone and parent maps so quests display correctly without needing to open the map first.
- **Quest bar layout** — Left offset for quest bars adjusted for more consistent layout.
- **Database refactor** — All references updated from `HorizonSuiteDB` to `HorizonDB` for consistency. Options panel and quest tracking aligned to the new saved variable name; TOC and changelog updated accordingly.
---

## [0.6.5] – 2025-02-10

### ✨ New Features

- **Hide in combat** — New option in General (Combat section): when enabled, the tracker panel and floating quest item button are hidden while in combat. When combat ends, visibility is restored according to your existing settings (instance visibility, collapsed state, quest content). When **Animations** is enabled, the tracker and floating button fade out over ~0.2s on entering combat and fade in on leaving combat.
- **Focus category order** — The order of categories in the Focus list (Campaign, World Quests, Rares, etc.) can now be customised. In the options popout (Appearance), reorder categories via drag-and-drop; the new order is saved and used for section headers and section header colors. Use "Reset order" to restore the default order.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Settings panel** — The options/settings UI has been updated for clearer layout and easier navigation.
- **New settings** — A range of new options have been added across General, Appearance, and other sections so you can tailor the tracker and behaviour to your preference.
---

## [0.6] – 2025-02-09

### ✨ New Features

- **World quest tracking** — World quests in your current zone now appear in the tracker automatically, using both `C_QuestLog` and `C_TaskQuest` data. No need to track every WQ manually.
- **Cross-zone world quest tracking** — World quests you track via the map watch list stay in the tracker when you leave their zone. They are shown with an **[Off-map]** label and their zone name. Use **Shift+click** on a world quest entry to add it to your watch list so it appears on other maps.
- **World map cache** — Opening the world map caches quest data for the viewed map and your current zone. World quests appear more reliably and update when you change map or close the map.
- **Map-close sync** — Closing the world map after untracking world quests there updates the tracker immediately so untracked WQs are removed.
- **Per-category collapse** — Section headers (Campaign, World Quests, Rares, etc.) can be clicked to collapse or expand that category. Collapse state is saved per category. Collapsing uses a short staggered slide-out animation.
- **Combat-safe scrolling** — Mouse wheel scrolling on the tracker is disabled during combat to avoid taint.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Focus category reorder UX** — The category order list in options now uses live drag-and-drop: a ghost row follows the cursor, an insertion line shows the drop position, the list auto-scrolls when dragging near the edges, and Reset order updates the list immediately. All Focus groups (Campaign, Important, Quests, etc.) are always shown.
- **Nearby quest detection** — Parent and child maps are considered when finding “nearby” quests, so quests in subzones and parent zones are included.
- **Active task quests** — Quests from `C_TaskQuest.IsActive` (e.g. bonus objectives, invasion points) are shown in the tracker under World Quests.
- **Zone change behaviour** — World quest cache is cleared on major zone changes (`ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA`) but kept when moving between subzones, reducing flicker when moving within a zone.
- **Delayed refresh** — An extra refresh runs 1.5s after login and after zone changes so late-loading quest data is picked up.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **TOC** — Version set to 0.6. SavedVariables corrected to a single line: `HorizonDB`.
- **Debug overlay removed** — The development-only world quest cache indicator (bottom-left of screen when the map was open) has been removed from release builds.
- **World map hook polling** — Reduced from 30 retry timers to 5 when waiting for the world map to load; map show/hide hooks no longer reference the removed indicator.

### Technical

- World quest data flow uses `C_QuestLog.GetQuestsOnMap`, `C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID`, and optional `WorldQuestDataProviderMixin.RefreshAllData` hook when available.
- Per-category collapse state is stored in `HorizonDB.collapsedCategories`.
