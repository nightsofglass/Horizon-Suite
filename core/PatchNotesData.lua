    Horizon Suite - Patch Notes Data
    Update this file each release. Key must exactly match ## Version in HorizonSuite.toc.
    In-game notes should be player-facing summaries — not every internal/CI entry.

    Per version table:
    - date = "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional but preferred) — store ISO for CHANGELOG parity; the dashboard shows long UK text
      (e.g. 31 March 2026) in parentheses after the version.
    - Array entries { section = "...", bullets = { ... } } — bullets may use "Module: rest"; the UI capitalizes the
      first letter after ": " when it is lowercase (ASCII). Data can stay lowercase after the colon if you prefer.
